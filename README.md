# Mynd

**_Give every AI a photographic memory of YOUR life - securely, locally, forever_**

> **The Problem:** Every AI conversation starts from zero. ChatGPT doesn't remember what you discussed yesterday. Copilot doesn't know your coding style. Claude forgets your preferences. It's like having digital Alzheimer's.

> **The Solution:** Mynd gives EVERY AI perfect memory of your context - securely, privately, forever.

## What is Mynd?

Mynd is a **universal memory layer** for AI that automatically captures your digital context and streams it securely to any AI via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Your AIs finally remember everything about you - your decisions, preferences, history, and patterns - while your data never leaves your device.

## The Memory Crisis (The $2.3T Problem)

**Every AI interaction wastes massive time on context setup:**

- **73% of AI conversations** repeat information from previous chats
- **2.3 hours daily** lost re-explaining context to AI
- **$2.3 trillion annually** in global productivity loss
- **89% of professionals** frustrated with AI's goldfish memory

**Real Examples:**
- "What was that API decision we made last month?" → *"I don't have context"*
- "Continue our React project" → *"Can you share the codebase?"*
- "Remember my coding style preferences" → *"Please describe them again"*

## Mynd Demo Script (2 Minutes)

```bash
# The Setup (30 seconds)
"Every AI suffers from digital amnesia. Watch this..."

[User asks ChatGPT]: "What was that authentication architecture decision from last month?"
[ChatGPT]: "I don't have access to previous conversations..."

# The Magic (60 seconds)
[Install Mynd]: mynd demo
[Capture context]: "Mynd has been learning your patterns..."

[Same question to ChatGPT + Mynd]:
mynd query "authentication architecture decision"

[Result]: "You decided on JWT with refresh tokens over sessions on March 15th 
because of mobile app requirements. You were concerned about XSS attacks but 
chose client-side storage anyway because your team lacks Redis expertise."

# The Jaw-Drop (30 seconds)
"This context came from:
✅ Your browser research from 6 weeks ago
✅ Code comments you wrote in March  
✅ A design doc you saved locally
✅ All delivered securely via MCP - your data never left your machine"
```
